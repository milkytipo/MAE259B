### Instruction of HW1 codes

1. Assignment 1
* Main_Three_Node_Explicit.m and Main_Three_Node_Implicit.m are all mothods solved by Newton methods.
* Main_Three_Node_analytical.m is the explicit method solved by analytical solution.
** Note: singular value may happen if Δt is larger in explicit method.*

2. Assignment 2
* Eleven_Nodes_Implicit.m is the script for the single N nodes simulation. The indicator *plot_subfig* set *0* if use this scrpt individually.
* plot_eleven_nodes_implicit.m is the script to plot comparison results given different nodes or Δt. When use it, don't forget to set *plot_subfig* to *1* in Eleven_Nodes_Implicit.m.

3. Assignment 3
* euler_bernoulli_beam.m is the script for the simulation of beam. The indicator *plot_subfig* set *0* if use this scrpt individually.
* plot_euler_bernoulli_beam.m plot_eleven_nodes_implicit.m is the script to plot comparison results given different P. When use it, don't forget to set *plot_subfig* to *1* in euler_bernoulli_beam.m.


### Instruction of HW2 codes

1. Assignment 1 -- Chapter 7
* main.m is the main function, just run the main function is okay.
